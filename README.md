Overview
This project focuses on detecting retinal diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model analyzes retinal images to identify various diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and other retinal abnormalities. The aim is to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing retinal diseases more efficiently and accurately through automated image analysis.

Dataset
The dataset contains labeled retinal images, annotated to indicate the presence or absence of diseases. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance effectively.

Algorithms Used
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification
Data Augmentation techniques to improve model generalization

Usage
To use the Retina Disease Detection model:

Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ocular-disease-detection.git](https://github.com/vbxll/Ocular-disease-detection/)

Navigate to the project directory:
cd retina-disease-detection

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script:
python retina_disease_detection.py

Results
The performance of the Retina Disease Detection model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations of the model's predictions and a detailed analysis of its effectiveness in detecting retinal diseases are included in the project report.
